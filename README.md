# EncoreCrawler
Source Code Repository

This project was originally created to provide a web service sample for my ApiPlayer project. It's able to pull up-to-date Encore winning numbers from OLG (Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation) website. You can also use it to check if your Encore number wins and how much the prize is.

The source code has been set up for continuous delivery on Azure website http://ipo.azurewebsites.net/.
